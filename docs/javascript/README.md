# Javascript Controllers

- All source files should end in `.js`.
- A `sync(request)` function must be defined that returns a `{ children: [...], status: {...} }` object.
- Source code can be spread across multiple files & the name of files is not important.
- Implemented with the [otto](https://github.com/robertkrimen/otto) library.
